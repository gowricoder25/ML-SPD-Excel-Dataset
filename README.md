### Student Performance Prediction

In this SPD dataset I have uploaded a sample dataset. In this i have worked on these features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize the impact of study hours, attendance, and other features.
Classification – Convert scores into categories (Pass/Fail, A/B/C/D) and build classification models

##About Dataset
The Student Performance Dataset is designed to evaluate and predict student outcomes based on various factors that can influence academic success. This synthetic dataset includes features that are commonly considered in educational research and real-world scenarios, such as attendance, study habits, previous academic performance, and participation in extracurricular activities. The goal is to understand how these factors correlate with the final grades of students and to build a predictive model that can forecast student performance.
